# PicAttendance PHP Extension
This PHP extension is part of PicAttendance (https://github.com/ruanslv/PicAttendance) and written in C++11. 

# Dependencies
OpenCV 2 (http://opencv.org/)

PHP-CPP (http://www.php-cpp.com/)

# Installation
Install the dependencies. Read through the Makefile and change something if necessary. It's very well documented! (Thanks to PHP-CPP for that.) If you are running Ubuntu, chances are you won't need to change anything. After that just run
```shell
make
sudo make install
```
and you are done. You might have to restart Apache.
